# Trend step size
The increment (in units of years) by which the `hat`-type means are evaluated.

## Syntax
```yml
trend step size: 1 # (0, 1]
```

## Usage
The default `trend step size` is 0.2 years, which means we get five predictions in every calendar year. For instance, between years 0 and 1, this equates to predictions at <!-- could be a bit confusing since you have 6 predictions below, not 5 as above, but I get why -->

    0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

This yields `hat`-type means that appear very smooth, especially when the trend is curvilinear. Increasing the step size saves computation time (and the size of in-memory JAGS objects), but at the cost of a smooth trend line. Consider the following:

The teal line corresponds to a `trend step size` of 1, while the salmon-colored line corresponds to the default `trend step size`. The larger `trend step size` gives the false impression that the change in the mean is stepwise linear, when in fact it is not. If using a larger `trend step size` to fit "lighter" models more quickly, this is worth bearing in mind.
