# Non-centered parameterization

## Syntax
```yml
parameterization info: non-centered
```

## Usage
When you see this sort of funnel-like shape in your funnel plots,
{{< figure src="funnel-plot.png" width=560 height=400 >}}
or the compressions / "squeeze" seen in these funnel traces,
{{< figure src="funnel-traces.png" width=560 height=400 >}}
then it may be time to consider a non-centered parameterization, which you can invoke by including the YAML block above in your analysis config file.

In the lower panel of the funnel traces, you can see that {{< katex >}}\sigma_{\beta_0}{{< /katex >}} drifts into smaller values and gets a bit "stuck". Basically, the sampler can't efficiently explore that parameter space. While stuck, the slopes {{< katex >}}\beta_j{{< /katex >}} compress / squish together, thereby creating the problematic funnel we saw in the first figure.

It's possible to escape this funnel with a small reparameterization, called the "non-centered" parameterization. We won't go into detail here, but the basic problem, and solution, is described by others. The outputs used to find evidence of a funnel (and hence a clue that the non-centered parameterization may be needed), are found [here]({{< ref "/docs/1-guide/c-outputs/output-dir/01-diagnostics/_index.md" >}}).
